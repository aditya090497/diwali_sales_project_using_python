# diwali_sales_project_using_python
Here I created a Data Ana;ysis Project using python in jupyter notebook to analyse a sales report of diwali season. The result and conclusion of the analysis is included in the jupyter notebook in the repository. The raw data that was used is also present in the form of csv file.

Special Thanks to Rishabh Mishra for providing the dataset and guiding the whole process.
