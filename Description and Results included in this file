diwali sales project using python
Here I created a Data Analysis Project using python in jupyter notebook to analyse a sales report of diwali season. 
The result and conclusion of the analysis is included in the jupyter notebook in the repository also. 
The raw data that was used is also present in the form of csv file.

*Result and Conclusion: Married women age group 26-35 yrs from
UP, Maharastra and Karnataka working in IT, Healthcare and Aviation 
are more likely to buy products from Food, Clothing and Electronics category.*
