diwali sales project using python
Here I created a Data Analysis Project using python in jupyter notebook to analyse a sales report of diwali season. The result and conclusion of the analysis is included in the jupyter notebook in the repository also. The raw data that was used is also present in the form of csv file.

*Result and Conclusion in single line: Married women age group 26-35 yrs from UP, Maharastra and Karnataka working in IT, Healthcare and Aviation are more likely to buy products from Food, Clothing and Electronics category.*



Special Thanks to Rishabh Mishra for providing the dataset and guiding the whole process.
